# FacultyManagementSystem
Managing data of faculties got easier.

This website lets faculties easily add all their details and save it for later use. On a click of a button, faculties can easily generate their CV and download it as PDF. Faculties can even assign their editing rights to someone else for a few days. It has other features for admin support like report generation, adding courses etc directly through the UI instead of the database. Faculties can even assign editing rights to any other member in case they are not available.
This website can automatically create the backend code for you for any given field. This means that if an admin wants to add the Date of Birth field, he has to fill a simple form only instead of creating the new column manaully in the table and writing the corresponding code for the same in all the files for CRUD operations. This saves the admin from the hassle of doing the manual work and automates the process for them.
